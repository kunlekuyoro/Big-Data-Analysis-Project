# Big Data Product: Burglary Protection 

In this scenario, you are a data scientist working with a marketing consultancy. Your client is an insurance company that is developing a highly segmented home insurance product. Since it is hypothesized that customers who live in an area where burglary is prevalent would be more interested in a new insurance policy, the company would like to find out whether “Burglary” is more frequent in particular areas of England. If that is the case the company needs to determine whether these are areas of affluence, where a premium policy with high benefits could be sold, or one of relative deprivation where a low-cost economic policy with proportionately lower pay-outs would be more appropriate. Furthermore, the company would like to target areas where burglary is known to be increasing. The questions to be answered are whether: 

1.	There are more burglaries in more affluent areas 

2.	 Burglaries are increasing, decreasing, or are stable

### To solve this problem, you will use publicly available data sets that have been prepared for you and placed in online. These include (but are not limited to):-

1.	Street Level Crime Data published by the UK Home Office, this dataset contains 19 million data rows giving a crime type, together with their location as a latitude and longitude.
2.	English Indices of Deprivation Data: The English Indices of Deprivation 2010 data set contains the rankings of measures of deprivation within small area level across England. The 32000 localities are ranked from the least to most deprived, scored on seven different dimensions of deprivation.

### Specifics
1.	Process the given data efficiently using Apache Spark on a cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform. A sample Jupyter Notebook has been provided.

2.	Filter the dataset so that crimes refer to Burglary only.

3.	Using appropriate techniques, determine whether Burglaries are increasing, decreasing, or are stable

4.	Using appropriate techniques, determine whether Burglary is more closely associated with areas of affluence, relative deprivation, or neither.

5.	Select and prepare no more than four visualizations to support your analytic findings from (3).

6.	Explain the reasoning behind your code so that it is clear what each block is intended to achieve, and why.

7.	Report critically on the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of the methods used.
